# Individual Exercise: Write a Custom Hook

We'll all mute our microphones and work silently in our own editors for 5-10 minutes. I'll have a separate breakout room to answer questions.
Recommendation: write your custom Hook inside one of the Feedback components or create a new component and write it there. Then you can test in the /average-react-app

After, we'll discuss as a group. Show and tell (for those who want to.)

## Ideas

1. Add a feature to our custom hook `useChuckNorris` such as pass a number to retrieve `n` number of jokes
2. Copy a hook from [useHooks](https://usehooks.com/)
3. Look at custom hooks in [`create-react-hook` README](https://github.com/Hermanya/create-react-hook#examples)

## Objectives

- Feel comfortable writing a custom Hook on your own

<!-- Speaker Notes

1. Move into breakout room
2. Tell people to privately message me when done (this way, we don't have the main chat room pinging.)
3. Have people send me their hook in a gist
4.
