## About The Workshop

Hooks are awesome because they're "first-class" utility functions provided by React to let you hook into state and other features while writing components. The cool thing about Hooks is that you can build on top of them to make your own. It’s like writing a function on top of lodash. You can gather something that might be reusable, and then package it up into a custom hook. That is the beauty of writing a shareable custom Hook in React.

### Workshop Goals

After completing this workshop, you will understand how to write custom Hooks in React, and publish them as npm packages for the open source community.

### Workshop Outcomes

By taking this workshop, you will learn how to:

1. Understand what a “first-class” Hook is and isn’t
2. Understand what a custom Hook is
3. Write a custom Hook in an existing application
4. Extract the Hook into a module
5. Test the Hook locally
6. Publish the Hook as an npm package

## Prerequisites

Although this workshop is not targeted at React experts you'll need the following:

- moderate React experience
- some familiarity with Hooks
- an [npm account](https://www.npmjs.com/signup)
